            NII NARKU QUAYNOR: AFRICAN FATHER OF THE INTERNET Did you know that
            Professor Nii Narku Quaynor, from Ghana, pioneered Internet
            development and expansion throughout Africa for nearly two decades,
            establishing some of the continent's first Internet connections and
            helping found key organizations, including the African Network
            Operators Group, to advance Internet connectivity and use in Africa?
            For his sterling efforts, Dr Quaynor has been inducted into the
            Internet Hall of Fame. Curtis Abraham went to interview him. Dr Nii
            Narku Quaynor's many achievements include helping to establish the
            Computer Science Department of the University of Cape Coast (UCC) in
            Ghana, where he has taught since 1979. He was also the first African
            to be elected to the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned
            Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees policies and protocols
            related to Internet domains and addresses, and served as an at-large
            director of ICANN for the African region from 2000 to 2003. Dr
            Quaynor was also a member of the UN Secretary General's Advisory
            Group on ICT, chair of the OAU Internet Task Force, and president of
            the Internet Society of Ghana. In 2007, the Internet Society awarded
            him the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award for his pioneering work in
            advancing the Internet in Africa. In 2012, he was inducted into the
            Internet Hall of Fame.

          <h2>Questions and answers from the interview I had some years ago</h2>
          <p>
            In this interview, Dr Quaynor talks about his hopes and fears for
            the future of the Internet in Africa. With African Internet user
            penetration currently standing at a mere 4.8%, Dr Quaynor warns that
            “Africa is about to miss a great development opportunity in much the
            same way Africa lost on the industrial revolution, unless serious
            and truly committed efforts are made by Africa to address the rapid
            expansion of the Internet user gap between Africa and industrialized
            countries.”

                Q: What was life like for you growing up in Ghana during the

              </summary>
              <p>
                Life was good growing up in Ghana. My family experienced no
                particular hardships at the time, although the instability of
                the coup d'état of 1966 [that overthrew President Kwame
                Nkrumah's government] was sufficient for several students to
                move overseas for education. I myself left Ghana and went to the
                US for my university education three years after the coup. It
                was not because of the coup, however, I was simply following a
                line of senior brothers who all went overseas for their
                university education.

              <p>
                I was the youngest in a family of scientists and although my
                father did not have a university education, my siblings included
                an eye surgeon, a dentist, a wood technologist, and a highway
                civil engineer. Coming from a noted scientific family, my
                strengths were clearly physics, pure maths, applied math's, and
                chemistry at A Level; and scoring 3 as I did at Achimota School.
                I also admired all my elder brothers who taught me a lot.

                Q: Did President Nkrumah's dream of making science and
                technology the key to rapid socio-economic development in Ghana
                have an influence on you?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Yes, but others such as Nelson Mandela also steered my focus
                towards achieving “techno-liberation”. It's evident that the
                lack of technical know-how has literally self-colonized Africa.
                Like both Nkrumah and Mandela, I am certain that Africa has to
                own its development processes. I also learnt from them that any
                society that lacks highly specialized knowledge, could churn out
                consumers who are not involved in the supply chain. The
                liberation and commitment could only have been instilled from
                the philosophy of liberation leaders like Nkrumah and Mandela.

                What was life like for you?
              </summary>
              <p>
                The culture shock was there but my purpose was to acquire
                knowledge, so it was easy to adjust. I arrived at Dartmouth
                College in 1969 when the civil rights movement was bringing
                about integration at the universities, and naturally I was
                always among a small group of Africans and African-Americans who
                faced the challenges of a new intellectual world. So in spite of
                the racial and social atmosphere during the early 1970s, the
                academic community encouraged those who wanted education. There
                was harmony when I studied, and it kept me not only out of
                trouble but also steered me into help.

                Yes, it brought attention to Africa's potential and its desire
                for participation in the global economy. Naturally, that
                struggle continued to remind me of my African roots and the fact
                that I had also become part of the diaspora. During my time at
                Dartmouth we were appalled when a well-known scientist, Walter
                Hermann Schottky, gave a lecture and students protested against
                his claims on race and intellectual capacity. This incident
                reminded us in the Diaspora that only Africans could liberate
                and develop Africa. That fact alone inspired me to want to help
                my people in my area of expertise. It planted in me a desire and
                dedication to struggle to acquire knowledge for the liberation
                and development of Africa.

                As one of the first PhDs in computer science on the African

                establish a department of computer science at the University of
                Cape Coast (UCC) in 1979. It was necessary to establish a
                computer science department to provide an alternative at UCC,
                and secondly to produce newer, more prepared students for the
                new computer industry of Internet-based solutions. I felt a
                commitment to Africa's development in this irreversible ICT
                revolution.

                Q: You have written of your optimism about Africa bridging the
                digital divide, given the fact that some African societies
                traditionally used calculating board instruments. Explain?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Africa can bridge the digital divide given its history of strong
                elements of Information Processing (IP) tools, such as its
                calculating board instruments. These instruments, like Oware,
                had supported early African societies with calculations such as
                addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of up to 10
                digits numbers. A set of calculating boards readily records
                information. Many Africans were of the view that computing was,
                generally, a foreign concept - this is not the case. Prior to
                the advent of Western education, Africans used the board for
                complex calculations. That board was as powerful as the Chinese
                abacus that served as the computing instrument for the people of
                Asia for many years. Thus, information processing is not foreign
                to African society, but it has not developed in synch with the
                rest of the world in more recent times, with the acceleration of
                new electronic technologies creating gaps to be mended. So
                Africa has used calculating instruments in the past, and is able
                to use the modern version with equal intensity.

              </summary>
              <p>
                In 1988, I started Network Computer Systems (NCS), a networking
                company. By 1994, NCS had become the first company in West
                Africa to operate Internet services by first using international
                dial-up to the Public I.P. Exchange Ltd (Pipex) in the UK.
                Thereafter, we focused our energies on sharing the knowledge
                with other operators in Africa, to accelerate the presence of
                the Internet in the sub-Saharan region.

                information sharing?
              </summary>
              <p>
                After NCS had acquired the technology in 1994, it shared with
                colleagues and proceeded to organise, to teach and to share.
                These efforts culminated in the formation of the African Network
                Operators Group (AfNOG). AfNOG is a forum for the exchange of
                technical information, and aims to promote discussion of
                implementation issues that require community cooperation through
                coordination and cooperation among network service providers to
                ensure the stability of service to end users. The goal of AfNOG
                is to share experience of technical challenges in setting up,
                building, and running Internet Protocol (IP) networks on the
                African continent. AfNOG held its maiden event in 2000, but the
                AfNOG annual event has now become a major meeting place of
                Africa's technical community, where global partners meet to
                share ideas. Being a community, our commitment is to support
                each other. AfNOG remains the principal vehicle of training,
                coordination, and exchange of technical information.

                principal challenge was the lack of technical capacity of
                professionals to man the complex systems. However, we were able
                to overcome that challenge by establishing a Department of
                Computer Science at the University of Cape Coast where we
                started training university graduates in computer science.
                Subsequently, as a teacher and researcher, I continued to train

                There needs to be proper management of Africa's information

                for developing countries to compete effectively in the global
                market because several of the required services - logistics,
                quality control, return policies, and the like - may not be on
                par internationally. Therefore, African countries should have
                policies that support local market development as a priority.
                Furthermore, strong local markets benefit key applications such
                as e-commerce and e-governance. Liberal and competitive markets
                are important in stimulating needed investment in the telecoms

                corporations who are not currently operating in African
                countries. Hence, African governments should devise policies and
                programmes that attract these multinationals to invest and

                ICT into their countries. Is it a point of view you share?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Yes, although one may go a little further from our computer
                networking orientation. After you have got the basic broadband
                infrastructure, things have to go through it and that is where
                the networking community comes in. For example, issues such as
                shutting down ISPs are stupid things of the past. So are
                reversals of privatisation policies - they are really bad
                because they affect investor confidence. In general, one needs
                to accelerate things such as e-commerce, telephony, etc, so that
                we can get traffic going on these systems. And in so doing, we
                can begin to have a more established share of our information
                society and feel some sense of ownership and drive towards
                achieving that established share.

                Q: You advised African governments that the continent would need
                at least two million locally trained ICT experts annually if
                Africa is to overcome the challenge of ensuring sustainable
                economic development through the use of the Internet. How did
                you arrive at such a figure? Has this target been achieved? Why
                or why not?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Africa has done well on the ICT awareness and use training
                aspect, but has not done so well with training engineers and
                computer scientists. Sustainable economies that use ICT and the
                Internet have a high percentage of university graduates and an
                equally high percentage of scientists and engineers. Thus
                training 10 million ICT professionals is to ask to produce less
                than 2% of the population, which is a modest goal.

              <p>
                The introduction of full Internet connectivity to Africa was
                achieved by engineers trained at ISOC Network Technology
                Workshops and subsequently by AfNOG's networking workshops. One
                would agree that the introduction of the Internet has
                transformed Africa, and it came about from acquiring technical
                knowhow.

                Q: You have controversially said to critics that affordable
                computing in Africa is more important than the basic necessities
                of life such as food and clean water. Explain?
              </summary>
              <p>
                Take for example, supplying water services in Africa on a large
                scale. This requires education as well as technology, which also
                includes computing network resources. That is how consumers are
                created. But it is the absence of this capacity that creates the
                vicious cycle of dependence alongside failure of service
                delivery. So, long discussions on whether we should take water
                or food are really immaterial in my opinion. What we are trying
                to do is to increase the penetration of Internet usage from the
                almost 5% we have currently in sub-Saharan Africa to the rest of
                the 95% who are without it. Yes, Africans need food, water, etc.
                but we also need affordable computing, which will help us to
                feed ourselves, as well as provide other basic necessities such
                as education, housing, sanitation, and in so doing help bring
                about socio-economic development.

                Q: Let's take the issue of healthcare. Has Internet access in

                medicines?
              </summary>
              <p>
                With an African Internet user penetration of 4.8%, one can
                hardly boast of Internet access having helped the poor to access
                clinics or healthcare. However, the role of the Internet should
                not be ignored since many clinics and hospitals in Africa now
                have email addresses and their employees have become Internet
                users. Furthermore, there is also the Telemedicine Task Force
                for Africa initiative, where the potential of satellite
                telecommunication technology was demonstrated as a tool for
                supporting healthcare systems in sub-Saharan Africa. It aims at
                extending e-health on the continent. This is becoming the norm
                as the Internet is being more widely used for healthcare
                purposes.

                too far away from the right to education. I consider it as a
                right that can reduce poverty by building knowledge-based
                societies.

                get genuinely committed folks to increase activities on the
                ground. I believe that Africa is about to miss a great

                I believe that the failure to utilise ICT in poverty reduction
                would lead to gross inequalities that would fuel global unrest
                and threaten peace and harmony. And for those who may question
                the basis for this caution, even though the entire African
                community is at risk, nonetheless important sub-groups may be
                identified. These include rural communities, the urban poor,
                women, youth, the disabled, orphans, senior citizens, street
                hawkers, workers, and Small and Medium Enterprises. The need,
                therefore, is to define specific programmes in ICT that focus on
                these groups. The indigenous, on the whole, are an at-risk group
                which needs special attention. The ICT programmes that focus on
                these groups should be clearly defined, identified, and
                addressed as part of the Global BDD Agenda.

                Regarding the Internet, one might say it is amorphous. In some
                regards, we have made gains and in other regards we have failed.
                Groups in metropolitan areas with a good education have
                certainly benefited in the narrowing gap, but that is not
                widespread. At less than 5% Internet user penetration, Africa
                cannot boast of having narrowed the gap between the developed
                and developing world. But we can claim that we have achieved
                that in a decade from scratch, and that is a good momentum for
                Africa. We see promise in the convergence of mobile phone

                The Internet is a very effective means of increasing economic
                growth. It improves the supply of services as well as access to
                the services, and the developing world would want to participate
                in both sectors. Africa should establish businesses that develop
                applications, resources and services to serve the domestic and
                international markets. An economy made up principally of users
                of internationally supplied Internet services would be at a
                disadvantage.
